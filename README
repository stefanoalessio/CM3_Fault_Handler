This repository contains a module to handle faults, giving detailed information using ARM exception registers.
I tried to replicate all register definition here to make it portable and not rely on any cmsis or vendor-specific
implementation, but the project was first created for a STM32 microcontroller, so keep it in mind if you experience
any problem. It is not meant to be a stand-alone program, but an example main.c is left for a usage example.
Tested on IAR form v5.4 to v7.10

This project is based on feabhas/CM3_Fault_Handler repository on GitHub. This is the original README file content:

ARM Cortex-M3/Cortex-M4 (ARMv7-M) Hard Fault Exception Handler

See blog.feabhas.com for full details.

Base project built using ARM/Keil MDK-ARM v4.60
